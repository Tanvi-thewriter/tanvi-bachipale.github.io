    <p>Welcome to my world of stories, rebellion, and emotion. I’m Tanvi Bachipale — a writer weaving dreams and discontent into tales that question, amuse, and rebel.</p>

  <section class="section" id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Tanvi Bachipale, born in 2007 in a small city Yavatmal in India, writes from a place between dreams and discontent. A self-taught storyteller with a head full of chaos and curiosity, she has been scribbling stories in her imagination since childhood.</p>
    <p>Her writing often leans into the emotional, and the unsaid—she's fascinated by the cracks in people and the silence between words. Her stories express a spectrum of emotions. Tanvi always makes an extra effort to add humour and hope for the readers.</p>
    <p>Characters she writes are one who don't always follow the rules. But instead, they rise a rebel.</p>
    <p>She doesn’t claim to have it all figured out—far from it. Her work is fuelled by questions. Her stories are her form of rebel; she seeks to voice the unheard through her writings which is a mix of traditional forms, ballets, poetry, short stories, novels and all.</p>
    <p>She is frantic fiction reader since she first discovered the school library at age of 11 when she was in class 6th.</p>
    <p>Tanvi has a whole life outside books and literature too—she is an amiable person, kind, helpful, friendly and highly optimistic. Her personality can be best compared to Luna Lovegood from Harry Potter, an optimistic, friendly yet mysterious personality.</p>
